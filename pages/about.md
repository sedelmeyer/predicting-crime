## Problem statement

Crime tends to be ubiquitous in all areas of the United States, including Boston and Cambridge. Pinpointing the exact causes of crime is impossible, as it is a highly nuanced and complex issue. However, factors such as gross income, economic disparity, and government infrastructure/support are often strong indicators. We wish to inspect factors that may be correlated and/or contributing to occurrences of Boston crimes and the types thereof (e.g., robbery, vandalism, etc). 

We choose to explore datasets freely available from the City of Boston institutional website, starting (as reccommended) from the Street Lights and Property Values dataset, and incorporating a wide variety of other sources that can help explain variability in frequency and type of crimes committed.

After collecting and unyfing the data, we plan to construct models that learn relationships between predictors and crime from a training set, assess their performance on unseen data, and extrapolate from their predictions to postulate possible causal factors linked to crime
