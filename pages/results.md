## Literature Review/Related Work

This project relied heavily on public datasets made available by the City of Boston [https://data.boston.gov/dataset](https://data.boston.gov/dataset) and [https://data.boston.gov/dataset](http://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/).  

Our approach was not influenced by any other projects that have looked at this problem in the past.  We wanted to tackle this issue with a fresh set of eyes.  We performed extensive EDA on datasets that we believed would have an impact on crime type.  A large portion of this project was focused on determining the appropriate predictors and feature generation.  

We relied heavily on course materials from [Harvard Universityâ€™s CS 109a](https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2019-CS109A) and online resource to help guide us as we coded this project.  Some of the websites we used are listed below.
