title: "City of Boston Neighborhood Demographics EDA"
---

[The neighborhood demographics notebook can be found here.](https://github.com/sedelmeyer/predicting-crime/blob/master/notebooks/015_EDA_neighborhood_demographics.ipynb)

By Boston neighborhood we have successfully pulled together demographic data in the following categories:
- Age 
- Housing Tenure
- Household Income
- Poverty Rate
- Educational Attainment/School Enrollment

For our **17 identified neighborhoods** we have created one master data frame including over **70 features** granting us flexibility for model experimentation. 

> Given that the demographics data is at an aggregated neighborhood level *(rather than by census tract)* further discussion is needed around model implementation.
