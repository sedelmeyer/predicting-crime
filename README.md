**DISCLAIMER:**
Please note that this project should not be interpreted as being any reflection of our socioeconomic  or  political views. We are not suggesting that one should try to predict crime for the sake of instituting targeted policing. We are aware of the harmful effects. This is purely an academic project whereby we are exploring data and making statistical predictions in an area that is vastly affected by many confounding, real-world complex factors. The goal for this project is to illustrate learned skills that align with the goals of the university course for which we are completing this project.
