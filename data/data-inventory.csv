By releasing the records of these interactions, BPD hopes to add transparency to the execution of the program while still protecting the privacy of the individuals involved. These records are sourced from two different record management systems, and the differences between the resulting files are described below.
About the FIO Records 2015 (New RMS) and 2016 Files

These records are compiled from the BPD’s new Records Management System (RMS) on the BPD's FIO program. The new RMS, which went live in June, 2015, structures the FIO information into two separate tables:

    FieldContact, which lists each contact between BPD and one or more individuals
    FieldContact_Name, which lists each individual involved in these contacts

While these two tables align on the field contact number (fc_num) column, it is not methodologically correct to join the two datasets for the purpose of generating aggregate statistics on columns from the FieldContact table. Doing so would lead to incorrect estimates stemming from contacts with multiple individuals. As noted in the Data Key (New RMS) file, several of the columns in the FieldContact table apply to the contact as a whole, but may not necessarily apply to each individual involved in the contact. These include:

    frisked
    searchperson
    summonsissued
    circumstances
    basis
    contact_reason

For example, the frisked column contains a value of Y if any of the individuals involved in a contact were frisked, but it would be inaccurate to assume that all individuals were frisked during that contact. As such, extrapolating from the frisked column for a contact to each individual and then summing across them would give an artificially high estimate of the number of people frisked in total. Likewise, the summonsissued column indicates when someone involved in a contact was issued a summons, but this does not imply that everyone involved in a contact was issued a summons.

For a detailed listing of columns in each table, see both tables of the Data Key (New RMS) file below.

Additional Notes

    The data provided is FIO information entered into the new system from June, 2015 through December, 2016, which includes some interactions which occurred before June, 2015 which were entered after the transition from the old system. For comprehensive analyses of interactions prior to the introduction of the new RMS, users will need to include data on interactions prior to June, 2015 from the 2015 (New RMS) file.
    These files are extracted from live databases which may have records added or updated at any time. As such, the number and content of records shared here may differ slightly from versions used to produce analyses such as those linked below, due to subsequent revisions to the underlying database records.
    A contact can consist of an observation of a vehicle, without direct contact with a person. This would create a record where no person-level details are recorded.

This data includes public housing owned by the Boston Housing Authority (BHA), privately- owned housing built with funding from DND and/or on land that was formerly City-owned, and privately-owned housing built without any City subsidy, e.g., created using Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) or as part of the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP). Information is gathered from a variety of sources, including the City's IDP list, permitting and completion data from the Inspectional Services Department (ISD), newspaper advertisements for affordable units, Community Economic Development Assistance Corporation’s (CEDAC) Expiring Use list, and project lists from the BHA, the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), MassHousing, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), among others. The data is meant to be as exhaustive and up-to-date as possible, but since many units are not required to report data to the City of Boston, DND is constantly working to verify and update it. See metadata for more information on the structure of the data and important notes.

The database only includes units that have a deed-restriction. It does not include tenant-based (also known as mobile) vouchers, which subsidize rent, but move with the tenant and are not attached to a particular unit. There are more than 16,000 tenant-based vouchers in the city of Boston which provide additional affordability to low- and moderate-income households not accounted for here.data censored to zip and neighborhood to protect vulnerable populations",2019-11-07

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",2019-11-07
